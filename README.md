# GoogleDrive-Untrash
Restore the entire Google Drive trash

# Introduction
I coded this quickly in order to restore several hundred thousand files from a Google Drive trash. This code restore the entire trash of a Google Drive account, each file is restored at its original place. I thought this piece of code could help other people! If you have a Google Drive trash to restore, but are not comfortable with the Google Drive API, or not comfortable with Ruby, feel free to contact me for a little help :)

# Install & run
```shell
# first: download your Google Drive API credentials
gem install google-api-client
ruby untrash.rb
```
